# JavaScript Mini Project # 2

## Requirements

1. The mini-project must use either an API or a file crafted for use with json-server. You must make at least one fetch request.

2. The mini-project needs to include at least two event listeners. They can both be the same event listener such as a "click" event on different buttons.

## Getting Started

1. Find your API or build your data with a .json file. If looking for an API, the site I use is this one (https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis?tab=readme-ov-file). Please vet your APIs before committing to them by reading documentation and testing them. Additionally, don't choose an API with an API key.

2. Come up with a concept and write user stories for it (a user will be able to...)

3. Add your files, do your first git commit, and then start building!

4. Work iteratively starting with the minimum viable product. Don't style until it's necessary, get your functionality to work first. Think in terms of your user stories and break them into smaller tasks and problems.

5. Once you're in a good place start styling and adding extra features.

6. Have fun!
